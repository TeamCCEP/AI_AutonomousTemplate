What are the key shipping documents involved in shipments?

Commercial Invoice: Used by importers for customs entry declaration, describing the import value for duties and taxes.
Packing Slip: Lists the items included in the shipment for verification.
Shipper’s Letter of Instruction: Provides specific instructions from the shipper to the freight forwarder or carrier regarding handling and delivery of goods.
Shipment Summary or Detail Report: Contains detailed shipment information including serial numbers, carton IDs, country of origin, and more.
How can I download shipping documents?

Authorized users with appropriate access can download shipping documents.
Access the "Print Shipping Documents" option via the designated system or portal.
Select the document type, enter search criteria (e.g., Purchase Order Number, Ship Set Number), and download the desired document.
Some product categories may have specific document types available in the shipping documentation tool.
When are shipping documents available for download?

Shipping documents are available once the order status is "Shipping" or "Invoiced."
Documents are only available for physical shipments, not for electronic delivery products.
Commercial invoices are generated per ship set; multiple ship sets mean multiple invoices.
Can I request shipping to a home address?

Shipping to a home address is allowed for catalog items below a specified value threshold.
Non-catalog items below a lower value threshold for office supplies and IT accessories may also be shipped to a home address if no asset account is required.
For higher value or asset purchases, shipping must be to an office or partner location.
Home addresses can be added and managed during the purchase requisition process.
How do I request changes or report issues with shipping documents?

Changes to shipping documents should be made while the order status is "Scheduled" or "Fulfillment in Progress" using the designated Change Order Tool.
For exceptions or after shipping has started, open a "Shipping Documentation" case via the customer service portal.
Shipping document changes are generally not permitted once lines reach "Shipping in Progress" status, except for rare exceptions.
What should I do if there is a short, over, or damaged shipment?

Open a "Shipment Delivery Issue" case in the customer service portal with details of missing or damaged items.
The shipping team will investigate internally and may create a replacement order if confirmed.
If opting out, the account owner must file a claim with the carrier.
How do I contact customer service for shipping-related queries?

Log into the customer service portal with your credentials.
Search for "Shipping Documents" and open a case under "Shipping Documentation."
Provide all required information such as case title, request type, sales order number, product type, and document type.
After submission, you will receive a case number and updates from the customer service team.
Are there any special considerations for specific product categories?

Some product categories have specific shipping programs and routing tools for managing ship methods.
Returns and warranty processes for hardware are managed through designated dashboards or portals.
Subscription licensing and returns have specific policies and processes.
What are the expected shipping times for different locations?

Domestic Shipments: Typically delivered within 2–7 business days depending on distance and carrier availability.
International Shipments:
North America and Europe: Usually 2–5 business days.

What are the typical shipping costs associated with different shipment types?

Parcel Shipments (up to 68 kg / 150 lbs): Shipped via parcel carriers such as FedEx, UPS, or DHL Express. Costs are generally calculated as a flat percentage of the net hardware cost or based on carrier rates.
Freight Shipments (above 68 kg / 150 lbs): Shipped via freight forwarders. Freight costs are higher and depend on weight, volume, and destination.
Shipping costs vary based on agreements with carriers and chosen shipping methods.
Some shipments may incur additional customs fees, duties, and taxes payable by the customer.
Unified carrier selection and shipping cost models aim to provide predictable and reliable delivery pricing.
